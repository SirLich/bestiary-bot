Bestiary Bot
=
Bestiary bot is a python-PRAW reddit bot which links the inspiration images for drawings posted to [r/bossfightBestiary](https://www.reddit.com/r/BossfightBestiary/). 

The Bossfight Bestiary is a sister subreddit to [r/bossfight](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bossfight/). Posts to the bestiary should contain drawings or other artistic content directly inspired by the bossfight subreddit.

This bot takes the title-text of bestiary submissions, does a search in the bossfight subreddit, and returns the top link formated as: "Here, I did my best to find the original".

The bot also ignores the contents of parens, which allow artists to annotate their titles.
